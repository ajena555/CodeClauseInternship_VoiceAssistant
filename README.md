# CodeClauseInternship_VoiceAssistant
I have created a voice assistant using simple python. It can perform various tasks as per your command which includes opening a website, opening any application,
making a note, searching a place in google map, searching for anything in google or youtube, telling you the current time and greet you according to the time.
It can also tell you random jokes, send an email and play musics.
I will add some more function as i will learn more in future.
